               This month we are going to try something new. We're going to have a 'round table' discussion, prompted by a series of open questions concerning JavaScript (the language) as well as the ecosystem.
            </p>

            <p>
              The idea is that everyone has something to share, from their experience with a certain library/framework right through to their ideals and beliefs about building systems in JavaScript. Let's share our opinions/positions and get a good, friendly debate going.
            </p>

            <p>
              No ticket required – you'll need only yourself and your opinions for this one :)
            </p>

            <p>
              <i>Note</i>: if you're new to JavaScript, please feel welcome to come along. The perspective of beginners will be especially useful for this format.

            <p>
               Code Golf is a group programming game where we compete against each other to come up
               with the shortest possible solution to a series of trivial problems. In this session,

               This month we have two talk sessions lined up.
            </p>

            <p>
              We'll be hearing about <a href="http://redux.js.org/index.html">Redux</a> and
              taking a dive into all things type systems and typing.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Session 1</b><br />
              Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test. Redux evolves the ideas of Flux, but avoids its complexity by taking cues from Elm.
              <br /> – <a href="https://twitter.com/sjmarshy">Sam Marshall</a>
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Session 2</b><br />
              JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, and that can be a real pain (Sorry, it's <span style="font-family:courier; background: #eee; border: solid 1px #ddd;">"" == 0</span>).
              In recent years, functional programming patterns have become increasingly popular in JavaScript, despite it not having the same static typing that most functional languages have. This talk takes a look through the underbelly of JavaScript's Type System, the common features of Types in Functional languages, and looks at strategies and tools for finding type errors in your JavaScript code.

              The lovely people at DueCourse will be supplying drinks and pizza for this one.
              If you love JavaScript, <a href="https://www.duecourse.com/jobs.html">check them out</a>, they're hiring.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Overview</b><br />
              Code &amp; Conquer is a group coding game in which teams compete to capture squares
              on a shared grid. The winning team is the team who, by the end of the game,
              has captured the most squares. Once a team owns squares, they must protect them from
              other teams attempting to steal them.
            </p>

            <p>
              The game client has been improved so you don't need to waste any time with plumbing
              code, and can instead focus on writing a winning strategy.
            </p>

            <p>

              As always, everyone is welcome, regardless of your level of JavaScript. Game sessions
              are a fun way to play around with code in a fun environment, or join a team and help

              Code &amp; Conquer is a group coding game in which teams compete to capture squares on a shared grid. The winning team is the team who, by the end of the game,
              has captured the most squares. Once a team owns squares, they must protect them from other teams
              attempting to steal them.

            <p>
              <b>Playing</b><br />
              You'll be given a default game client (a small Node app), allowing you to play the game at human-scale
              immediately. However, with 30 requests per minute, unless you're working efficiently at one
              command every 2 seconds, you're going to need to reprogram the client to play better :)

               Our next event is Wednesday December 2nd, and since that's just too close to Xmas
               for anything serious, we'll be doing something a bit different.
            </p>

            <p>
               This month we'll be hosting an old-school programming/tech pub quiz.
               Questions could be anything vaguely considered to be a technology/programming question.
             </p>

             <p>
               Since the questions will broadly cover the entire subject of software development, we
               welcome folks from other groups to put a team together and join us!
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Important: Venue Change</b><br />
              The awesome folks at <a href="https://twitter.com/McrThinkRise">Rise</a> will be
              hosting us for the evening, and supplying us with some drinks. See <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/233+Deansgate,+Manchester+M3+4EN/@53.4774239,-2.252265,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x487bb1e81dd756fd:0x3fff751fd56ed1ea">map</a> if you need some help finding the venue.
            </p>

            <p>
              Note: we're starting at 19:30, a little later than normal.

            </p>

            <p>
               Code Golf is a group programming game where you compete against everyone else to come up
               with the shortest possible solution to a series of trivial problems. The difference this time
               is that we'll be able to use <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/docs/es6/">some ES6 features</a>
               (those available in the latest node release).
            </p>

            <p>
              All you need is <b>your laptop</b>, a text editor and a willingness to write code you feel
              truly ashamed of.

              This month we have a brand new game session: <b>Code &amp; Conquer</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Important</b><br />
              This is a bring your laptop session – please have your code editor of choice, and
              <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node.js</a> installed.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Overview</b><br />
              The game starts with a square grid. The winning team is the team who, by the end of the game,
              has captured the most squares. Once you own a square, you must protect it from other teams
              attempting to steal it.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Gameplay</b><br />
              Using the default game client (a simple Node app), you send commands to the game server in real time to
              play your particular strategy. You can send <i>attack</i>, <i>defend</i> and <i>query</i> commands.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>attack</b>: takes 1 health point off the specified cell. If you cause the cell's health to drop
              to 0, you become the new owner and the cell's health is set to 120.<br /><br />

              <b>defend</b>: adds 1 health point to the specified cell. A cell's health is capped at 120.
              You can defend any cell on the grid, including cells you don't own.<br /><br />

              <b>query</b>: retrieves the current state of the grid. Each cell has a state which shows:<br />

              <ul>
                <li>The cell owner</li>
                <li>The cell health</li>
                <li>The cell bonus – some cells count for double or triple</li>
                <li>Who has attacked and defended the cell since it was last owned</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
              All cells are initially owned by the game, with a health of 60. You start with 30 requests,
              which are replenished every 1 minute. <i>attack</i> and <i>defend</i> commands use 1 of your
              30 requests, but <i>query</i> commands are free.
            </p>

            <p>
              You'll be supplied with a default game client, allowing you to play the game at human-scale
              immediately. However, with 30 requests per minute, unless you're working efficiently at one
              command every 2 seconds, you're going to need to reprogram the client to play better :)

              <b>Is tooling hurting us?</b><br />
              At this point we have a plethora of frameworks, libraries, compile-to-JS languages, etc. Do we need it all? Is it good or bad?
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Flexibility vs. safety – do we need more control over typing?</b><br />
              Should we be encouraging tools and language features that bring in typing/type hints?
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Is full stack JS a benefit?</b><br />
              Is there a reason why full stack JS is better than using a mix of other technologies?
            </p>

              <b>Here's the plan:</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              First hour: choose a random compile-to-JS language from a hat and learn enough to do the <a href="http://invalidcast.tumblr.com/post/52980617776/the-ordered-jobs-kata">Ordered Jobs Kata</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              Second hour: present a case for why the language doesn't suck (or does suck, if you prefer), demonstrating how it helped or hindered in solving the kata.
            </p>

            <p>
              Overall it should be a fun way to get a sense of what other languages are out there and get an idea of how some of them take very different approaches to JavaScript.
            </p>

              <b>Important: don't forget to bring your laptop.</b> We'll be doing everything online, so you won't need anything else.

               For February's session, <a href="https://twitter.com/glenathan">Glen Mailer</a> is joining us from <a href="https://twitter.com/sheffield_js">SheffieldJS</a> to talk about <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              The session will be an introduction to the thinking behind the new React JavaScript library, open sourced by Facebook Engineering. It presents a fresh take on how to effectively build rich user interfaces, questioning and abandoning some of what is currently considered "best practice".
            </p>

            <p>
              We'll take a look at how the library works, how it fits into a frontend web stack, and what makes it worth using. After brushing up on the theory, we'll see how it works in practice by building up a sample application.

              2015 is almost upon us, but fear not, you have one final chance in 2014 to get
              your JavaScript fix. This month we're playing Performance Golf.
            </p>

            <p>
               If you're a MancJS regular, you've probably been to a Code Golf session once or
               twice before – the game where we compete to create the smallest possible solutions
               to simple problems (demonstrating beautifully who is able to abuse JS the most).
            </p>

            <p>
               While Code Golf is fun, it's also not very useful. So, for this month's session
               we've changed it up a bit. We're now competing to see who can create the most
               time-efficient solutions instead – hence Performance Golf.
            </p>

            <p>
              We'll start out with an example so everyone gets the idea, and then play 2 or 3
              main games. You need only your laptop and a code editor, the rest is server-based.
            </p>

            <p>

               Back in July 2013 (our 5th MancJS event) we ran something called <a href="#hack-the-server-hash">Hack The Server</a>. The idea was
               to work through a set automated challenges in small teams, competing with everyone else to be the first to complete them.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since it will have been exactly 1 year ago, we're brining it back for July's event. The challenges have been improved, the special roles
              are back and we even have a few prizes from <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> to give to the first three winning teams.

            <p><b>Session Details</b></p>

            <p>
              Parsing computer languages is often seen as an arcane, complex art only practiced by Computer Science PhDs to write compilers. But actually, tools exists to make writing parsers for computer languages or data formats much easier. And they're useful for much more than compiling - syntax highlighters, code formatters and simple error checkers (eg lint tools) are not that hard to write.
            </p>

            <p>
              The session will introduce Parsing Expression Grammars in JavaScript. Parsing Expression Grammars are not that much harder to write than regular expressions, but are much more powerful. They can even <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags" target="_blank">parse XHTML</a>. Ash will start by showing us how to write a parser for a simple list syntax, and then with this as an example, everyone will pair up and have a go at writing a parser for JSON data. There will be a template project that already contains test cases for sample JSON strings, starting with simple examples and building up to the full syntax.
            </p>

            <p>
              Don't worry if you don't consider yourself a JavaScript or regex ninja, a basic grasp will do, and we'll make sure everyone is well paired up.

               MancJS is nearly here again and this month we're going to play a few rounds of JavaScript golf.
               Don't worry, it's really easy to play. We start with a simple problem and the winner is the one
               who can solve it in the fewest [key]strokes.
            </p>

            <p>
              We'll play about 4 x 20 minute rounds and work in pairs. To keep things fair, the pairs
              will be randomised each round to keep the JS expertise flowing evenly :)

              This month we have a more hands-on event.
            </p>

            <p>
              We'll get into pairs or small groups, and in the spirit of 'learn by doing', we'll all build the same basic web app. There are no rules. The idea is simply to focus on a specific element of the app (or all of it) that either you're best at, or want to learn about most within your pair/group.
            </p>

            <p>
              Maybe you're more frontend and want to show us how you build a better experience. Maybe you're more backend and want to share how you architect/organise the app. Maybe you'd prefer to follow a process like TDD and show us how you use tests to guide you toward a feature. Maybe you want to show off the features of your favourite database. Whatever.
            </p>

            <p>
              Afterwards we'll share our approaches, tools, ideas and allow everyone to learn from each other. It'll be a great way to see how we work in real life and allow us to take away some of the approaches and tools that we've not seen or used before.
            </p>

            <p>
              As always, absolutely everyone is welcome – we're all here to learn.

              10gen are hosting a full day MongoDB conference on April 9th in London. More details here <a href="http://www.10gen.com/events/mongodb-london-2013" target="_blank">http://www.10gen.com/events/mongodb-london-2013</a>
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
              So if you fancy a full day of MongoDB in London on April 9th, <a href="mailto:mancjs@martinrue.com">email me</a> and I'll pass along the discount code you need.

            <p>Thanks to everyone who attended the first event!</p>

            <p>
              Hopefully everyone learnt something about JavaScript and wasn't too mentally taxed in the process. The <a href="/files/questions.zip">questions and answers are here</a> for anyone who wants to keep them as a reminder of their pain.
            </p>

            <p>
              There's a good amount of feedback and it looks like hot topics for next time are nodejs, testing, frameworks (backbone/angular/express) and project structure/architecture.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>So, if you'd like to give a short talk on any of these subjects please <a href="mailto:mancjs@martinrue.com">email me</a> and let's organise it.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              You don't need to be an expert to talk – just come and share your experience with one of the subjects mentioned above in a short 15-20 minute talk. The more talks we have the better!

            <p><strong>Welcome to the first mancjs!</strong></p>

            <p>
              We'll be kicking off the first event with a kind of pub quiz, but for JS.
              In teams of 2 or 3, we'll go head-to-head to find out who knows most
              about how batshit crazy JS can be.
              <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXEgk1Hdze0" target="_blank">Wat?</a>
            </p>

            <p>
              Afterwards, teams that got questions right can explain to the group why the code
              behaved the way it did, and hopefully we'll all learn something :)
            </p>

            <p>
              You don't need to be a JavaScript whiz to attend – absolutely everyone is welcome.
