               This month we're sticking with the talks and have 2 more interesting subejcts before we retire to the pub.
            </p>

            <p>
              1: <b>API benchmarks – why are they important, and how?</b><br />
              In this session we'll see how to benchmark APIs in order to know how they react to high volumes of traffic and how we, as developers, can be prepared when they need to scale.<br />

              2: <b>Introduction to building web based mobile apps using Apache Cordova</b><br />
              Chris will show us how to use the web technologies we know and <strike>love</strike> tolerate to build packaged native mobile applications using the <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Apache Cordova</a> project.<br />

               This month <a href="https://twitter.com/patchspace" target="_blank">Ash Moran</a> will be teaching us how to parse JSON strings and produce real JavaScript objects, without relying on things such as eval.
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Important:</strong> please bring your laptop and make sure you have <a href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank"> NodeJS</a> installed.
            </p>

            <p><b>Session Details</b></p>

            <p>
              Parsing computer languages is often seen as an arcane, complex art only practiced by Computer Science PhDs to write compilers. But actually, tools exists to make writing parsers for computer languages or data formats much easier. And they're useful for much more than compiling - syntax highlighters, code formatters and simple error checkers (eg lint tools) are not that hard to write.
            </p>

            <p>
              The session will introduce Parsing Expression Grammars in JavaScript. Parsing Expression Grammars are not that much harder to write than regular expressions, but are much more powerful. They can even <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags" target="_blank">parse XHTML</a>. Ash will start by showing us how to write a parser for a simple list syntax, and then with this as an example, everyone will pair up and have a go at writing a parser for JSON data. There will be a template project that already contains test cases for sample JSON strings, starting with simple examples and building up to the full syntax.
            </p>

            <p>
              Don't worry if you don't consider yourself a JavaScript or regex ninja, a basic grasp will do, and we'll make sure everyone is well paired up.

               MancJS is nearly here again and this month we're going to play a few rounds of JavaScript golf.
               Don't worry, it's really easy to play. We start with a simple problem and the winner is the one
               who can solve it in the fewest [key]strokes.
            </p>

            <p>
              We'll play about 4 x 20 minute rounds and work in pairs. To keep things fair, the pairs
              will be randomised each round to keep the JS expertise flowing evenly :)

              As always, absolutely everyone is welcome.
              If you're new to JS, this will be a fun way to dive into the language syntax (and learn to hack it).

              There'll be a few additional hands added to the game to allow for smarter strategies, but the goal

              This month we are going through the <a href="https://github.com/liammclennan/JavaScript-Koans" target="_blank">JavaScript Koans</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              As a group we'll work through the koans together. This session will be especially useful to people who aren't too familiar with JavaScript and would like a gentler introduction to the language via testing.
            </p>

            <p>
              If there's time, we'll also take a look at some real tests and see how easy it is to set up a test environment using node.
            </p>

            <p>
              As always, everyone is welcome.

              Our third MancJS event will be May 01st at <a href="http://manchester.techhub.com" target="_blank">TechHub Manchester</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
              In a cunning attempt to top last month's generosity, TechHub are going to ply us with free pizza and booze again, so <a href="http://mancjs-may.eventbrite.co.uk" target="_blank">please sign up</a> if you're coming.
            </p>

            <p>
              <b>Important: if you have a laptop, please bring it with you or this isn't going to work at all :)</b>
            </p>

            <p>
              This month we have a more hands-on event.
            </p>

            <p>
              We'll get into pairs or small groups, and in the spirit of 'learn by doing', we'll all build the same basic web app. There are no rules. The idea is simply to focus on a specific element of the app (or all of it) that either you're best at, or want to learn about most within your pair/group.
            </p>

            <p>
              Maybe you're more frontend and want to show us how you build a better experience. Maybe you're more backend and want to share how you architect/organise the app. Maybe you'd prefer to follow a process like TDD and show us how you use tests to guide you toward a feature. Maybe you want to show off the features of your favourite database. Whatever.
            </p>

            <p>
              Afterwards we'll share our approaches, tools, ideas and allow everyone to learn from each other. It'll be a great way to see how we work in real life and allow us to take away some of the approaches and tools that we've not seen or used before.
            </p>

            <p>
              As always, absolutely everyone is welcome – we're all here to learn.

            <p>Thanks to everyone who attended the first event!</p>

            <p>
              Hopefully everyone learnt something about JavaScript and wasn't too mentally taxed in the process. The <a href="/files/questions.zip">questions and answers are here</a> for anyone who wants to keep them as a reminder of their pain.
            </p>

            <p>
              There's a good amount of feedback and it looks like hot topics for next time are nodejs, testing, frameworks (backbone/angular/express) and project structure/architecture.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>So, if you'd like to give a short talk on any of these subjects please <a href="mailto:mancjs@martinrue.com">email me</a> and let's organise it.</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
              You don't need to be an expert to talk – just come and share your experience with one of the subjects mentioned above in a short 15-20 minute talk. The more talks we have the better!

            <p><strong>Welcome to the first mancjs!</strong></p>

            <p>
              We'll be kicking off the first event with a kind of pub quiz, but for JS.
              In teams of 2 or 3, we'll go head-to-head to find out who knows most
              about how batshit crazy JS can be.
              <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXEgk1Hdze0" target="_blank">Wat?</a>
            </p>

            <p>
              Afterwards, teams that got questions right can explain to the group why the code
              behaved the way it did, and hopefully we'll all learn something :)
            </p>

            <p>
